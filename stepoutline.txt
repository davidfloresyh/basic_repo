These are the steps I took in the project:
1. I created the directory on my desktop
2. I created the repo in github
3. I created 3 files and added some content
4. I added, committed and pushed these files to github
5. I made some changes to the files and then pushed them again to github
6. I then went to github and checked out the repo and the files
7. I then created this file in the repo
8. I used nano to open it up and add these steps.

I plan on uploading this file now.
